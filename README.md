# New Map Template

## Getting Started

**[Use this template to create a your own repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)**

If you haven't already, you'll need to create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

You will need to [configure GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow) to use 'GitHub Actions' as the source, and update the repository name in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](https://github.com/robgaston/new_map/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L19) (change "new_map" on line 19 to match your repository name).

**The easiest way to start development is to create a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) using this repository.**

### Running locally
**If you are not using Codespaces**, to run locally you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

After installing Git for the first time, you'll need to configure it by running the following from the [VS Code integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics) (replace the quoted text with your name/email address):
```sh
git config --global user.name "<your name>"
git config --global user.email "<your email>"
```

Then setup VSCode to start working:
- Install the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)
- [Clone the repository](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_cloning-a-repository) you've created from this template using VS Code
- [Sign into GitHub with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_getting-started-with-github-pull-requests-and-issues)
- Install the package dependencies by running the following from the root directory of your cloned repository:
```
npm install
```

## Development
To start the app, run the following from the root directory of your cloned repository:
```
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000/ (see forwarded ports if using Codespaces).

Changes that you make to javascript and CSS files will be automatically refreshed.

## Deployment
To deploy your latest code to the web, simply commit and push your changes to the `main` branch in Github.
